## Overview

Pre-digitisation curation and staging is the first task cluster in the
process of digitisation of biological and palaeontological collections (Nelson *et al.*, 2012). This step is usually viewed as
essential to efficient digitisation but often has benefits that extend beyond the immediate needs of
the digitisation itself.

This page outlines a pre-digitisation curation checklist which allows the user to perform a self-assessment to understand if a collection is ready to proceed with digitisation.
The checklist contains check boxes for the user to indicate decisions and logical steps in preparing the collection, and where relevant useful links and references have been provided. In some cases,
case studies have been described and are linked to in the checklist.

Some sections of the checklist are still to be developed, as they link closely with other [DiSSCo Prepare](https://www.dissco.eu/dissco-ppp/) work packages. This page will be updated when these tasks are complete.

## Pre-Digitisation Curation Checklist

### 1. Detailed inventory of the collection (Number of Specimens)
<details>
	<summary><strong>Click here to expand</strong></summary>
	<p>Before you start digitising your collection, it is really important to know the content of your
	collection. If you do not have a clear overview of the type of collections, the numbers, the
	arrangement and the status of your collection, it is very hard to estimate the work and the costs of
	your future digitisation projects.</p>
	
	<p>For case studies see <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6511350">Detailed inventory of the collections for DiSSCo Flanders</a> and 
	<a href="/PreDigCuration/PDCaseStudies.html#setting-natural-science-data-free-scoping-uk-collections-disscouk">Scoping UK Collections</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>1.1 Kind of collections</h3>
	<p>The approach to digitising each collection can be very diverse. Therefore, it is very important to
	divide your collection into different sub-collections with a similar digitising approach. List the
	numbers for the different kinds of collections. It is also useful to know if these collections are kept
	separately or not, as it will influence the workflow.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Microscope slides </li>
		<li>Skins and vertebrate material </li>
		<li>Liquid preserved specimens </li>
		<li>Pinned insects </li>
		<li>Herbarium sheets </li>
		<li>3D objects</li>
		<li>Other </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>1.2 Estimation of the numbers of your (sub)collections</h3>
	<p>For each kind of collection type, it is useful to have a trustworthy estimate of your holdings. It will not
	only facilitate the project planning related to management, staff, equipment and working space but it
	is also important when you want to outsource your imaging and/or transcription. Mass digitisation of
	a collection is only cost effective above a minimum threshold of the number of specimens.</p>
	
	<p>For case studies see  
	<a href="/PreDigCuration/PDCaseStudies.html#estimation-of-the-numbers-of-the-african-and-belgian-herbarium-collection-at-meise-botanic-garden">Estimation of the herbarium
	collection at Meise Botanic Garden</a> and <a href="/PreDigCuration/PDCaseStudies.html#estimation-of-collection-size-at-the-nhm-london">Estimation of collection size at NHM London</a>.</p>

	<h3>1.3 Classification system of the different collections</h3>
	<p>The classification of your collection is crucial in the way you can set up your digitisation workflow.
	Some information can only be found on the specimen itself but some information can be found on
	the folders/drawers/cupboards and is the same for all specimens in the same folder/ drawer/
	cupboard. That information is very valuable as it can be directly linked to all specimens in it. This can
	save time and money.</p>
	<p>For example vascular plant specimens in the herbarium BR of Meise Botanic Garden are stored in
	alphabetical order by family, genus and species. Therefore we could digitise the filing name from the
	folders (a QR code was added to a folder every time the filing name changed) instead of digitising it
	from the sheets. So all the folders with a QR code were imaged as well and based on these images,
	the filing name was transcribed. This QR code of the filing name was linked to all the specimens that
	followed. It saved us a lot of duplicate work as on average 1 folder was linked to 10 sheets.</p>
	
	<h3>1.4 Assessment of the condition of your (sub)collections</h3>
	<p>A crucial step in the pre-digitisation phase is to find out the curational status of your collection to
	know how much curatorial work is needed before your collection is ready for digitisation. As you will
	probably digitise your collections only once, you would want to do it properly.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.synthesys.info/network-activities/synthesys3-na3.html">The SYNTHESYS3 NA3 deliverable 3.3 report</a> describes the outcome of a questionnaire that was sent
	around to 18 partners to review digitisation workflows and the used equipment. Two thirds of the
	institutions that completed the questionnaire performed at least some minimal curation or
	conservation steps prior to digitisation.</p>
	
	<h4>1.4.1 Curation Status</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Mounting needed</li>
		<p>As mounting is much more time consuming than imaging (for herbarium specimens it
		is 50 to 5000 per day, Guiraud et al. 2020), it is best to decouple the mounting
		process from the digitisation workflow.</p>
		<li>Desleeving/unfolding/opening needed</li>
		<li>Cleaning needed</li>
		<li>Restoration needed</li>
		<li>Renewal of the folders/boxes/jars/drawers needed</li>
		<li>Refiling needed</li>
		<p>For example removing obviously incorrectly filed items</p>
		<li>No curation needed</li>
	</ul>

	<p>While checking the curatorial state of your collection, you can already start making a list of necessary
	supplies (see <a href="/PreDigCuration/PDChecklist.html#3-supplies">section 3</a> for supply lists).</p>
	
	<h4>1.4.2 Curation Status</h4>
	<ul>
		<li> Toxicity list & risk assessment</li>
		<p>Many collections have been treated in the past with chemicals that are now
		considered as unsafe: herbarium collections could have been treated with mercury,
		nitrobenzene, naphthalene (in mothballs) or other chemicals; vertebrate skins with
		arsenic, geology collections store asbestos-containing material or can be radioactive.
		Liquid collections can contain formaldehyde or other harmful substances. Mould and
		biological hazards form other problems that can be found in collections.</p>
		<p>List all the toxins that were used in your collection to make sure that you take the
		necessary precautions.</p>
		<p>This is not only necessary for the people who work with the collections on a daily
		basis but it is also important when you plan to outsource the digitisation of your
		collection. It is recommended to inform the external company and to make a risk
		assessment.</p>
	</ul>
	<p>For a case study see <a href="/PreDigCuration/PDCaseStudies.html#decontamination-of-parts-of-the-herbarium-at-meise-botanic-garden">Decontamination of parts of the herbarium</a> at Meise Botanic
	Garden, and useful literature can be found <a href="https://know.dissco.eu/handle/item/403/simple-search?filterquery=Toxicity&filtername=subject&filtertype=equals">here</a></p>
	
	<h4>1.4.3 Labels readable</h4>
	<p>It is important to know is the readability of the specimen labels when digitised. Sometimes they are
	hidden underneath (part of) the specimen and will not be readable from the image. Will you
	reposition the label before digitisation? Will you transcribe the information from the specimen itself
	or from the image?</p>

### 2. Prioritisation list of (sub)collections
<details>
	<summary><strong>Click here to expand</strong></summary>
	<p>This prioritisation of collections is extensively treated in WP1 of DiSSCo Prepare, and this section of
	the checklist will be updated once this deliverable is complete. Useful literature can be found <a href="https://know.dissco.eu/handle/item/166/simple-search?filterquery=Prioritisation&filtername=subject&filtertype=equals">here.</a></p>
	
	<h3>Based on</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Size</li>
		<li>Origin</li>
		<li>Readiness</li>
		<li>Scientific Importance</li>
		<li>Historical Importance</li>
		<li>Which collections can be mass digitised</li>
		<li>Funding situation (opportunities, obligations to funders)</li>
		
	</ul>	
</details>

### 3. Supplies
<details>
	<summary><strong>Click here to expand</strong></summary>
	<p>Enough supplies are essential when you start digitising your collection. Bear in mind that it is most of
	the time cheaper to buy material in bulk. This however will possibly mean that you have to tender to
	get the necessary materials. For a case study, see <a href="/PreDigCuration/PDCaseStudies.html#ordering-supplies-for-pinned-insect-digitisation-natural-history-museum-london">Ordering supplies for pinned insect
	digitization</a>.</p>

		</ul>				
	</ul>
	
	<h3>3.2 Cleaning</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>cloths, alcohol</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>3.3 Storage</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>boxes, drawers, folders, cupboards, jars, vials, racks, stoppers</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>3.4 Barcodes</h3>
	<p>When buying barcodes you have to decide on the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Format (2D, QR, data-matrix)</li>
		<li>Info on/in the barcode (machine and human readable)</li>
		<li>Size</li>
		<li>Label material</li>
		<li>Paper quality (conservation grade)</li>
		<li>Pre-cut or pre-punched</li>
		<li>One or two-sided</li>
		<li>Fixation (wire, glue, self-adhesive, pierced…)</li>
		<li>Quality of the adhesive</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Make sure that the adhesives used are of high quality as you don’t want them to come off and end
	up in a pile at the bottom of a cabinet/drawer. Also make sure that the adhesive used is harmless for
	the specimens where you add them to.</p>
	
	<p>Kinds of barcodes you may need to use:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Specimen barcodes</li>
		<li>Drawer barcodes</li>
		<li>Barcodes for cupboards</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Useful literature on barcodes can be found <a href="https://know.dissco.eu/handle/item/404/simple-search?filterquery=Barcodes&filtername=subject&filtertype=equals">here</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>3.5 Track and trace</h3>
	<p>If you want to keep track of what happened with your specimens and where they are in the
	digitisation process you can set up a track and trace system.</p>
	<p>For example when you conduct the digitisation in house, you can add a sheet with a to-do list
	(preparation, adding barcodes, restoration, imaging, databasing, freezing,...) to each drawer/pigeon
	hole/storage unit where you can tick what has already been done.</p>
	<p>When you are outsourcing the digitisation, you can ask the external company to describe a track and
	trace system so that it allows them to remove the specimens from the original spot and put them
	back correctly after digitisation. It also will allow them to trace the specimens back to the correct
	storage location in case anything goes wrong.</p>
	<p>Once you have set up your track and trace system, you can start listing the material you need for it.
	This can be:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Paper, stickers, magnets, barcodes, trolleys, boxes</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>3.6 IT Infrastructure</h3>
	<p>A reliable IT infrastructure will make or break your digitisation project and is one of the first things
	you will have to invest in. Especially hardware for storing your images safely. More information can be found in our <a href="/DataETL/InfrastructureRecs.html"> Data (Extract, Tranform and Load)</a> IT Infrastructure Guidance.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hardware for long term storage/ cooperation with an external institution specialised in longterm archiving.</li>
		<li>Hardware for temporary/local storage</li>
		<li>Backup storage</li>
		<li>Servers</li>
		<li>Stations for QC images</li>
		<li>Stations for transcription</li>
		<li>Stations for QC transcriptions</li>
		<li>Software</li>
		<ul>
			<li>For image acquisition</li>
			<li>Image display</li>
			<li>Post processing</li>
			<li>Monitoring</li>
			<li>Quality control</li>
			<li>Archiving</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Cloud storage</li>
		<li>Portal</li>
		<li>CMS</li>			
	</ul>
	
	<h3>3.7 Digitisation Stations </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Camera</li>
		<li>Lens</li>
		<li>Lighting</li>
		<li>Table</li>
		<li>Computer<li>
		<li>Software</li>
		<li>IT storage (local, disk, server, cloud, image transfer)</li>
		<li>Background</li>
		<li>Equipment for specimen mounting</li>
		<li>Tripod/stand</li>
		<li>Set of scales and color charts</li>
		<li>Connection cables, batteries and accessory</li>
		<li>Logo of your institute</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>3.8 Space for infrastructure of external company</h3>
	<p>If you decide to outsource (part of) the digitisation but plan the digitisation itself in your own
	institute, make sure you have a spare room where the external company can install their digitisation
	infrastructure. It should be easily accessible and close to the collections. The space should be suitable
	to locate additional workplaces for the external project management and break rooms. Clarify access
	to existing infrastructure (restrooms, meeting rooms) of your institution and agree on facility
	management tasks of the space (e.g. cleaning). Foresee enough access points for electricity and a link
	to the server room of your institute.</p>
	<p>At Meise Botanic Garden, we added a floor plan to the tender with (if possible) a few options of
	where the installation could be set up. We also added our preference location but this way the
	external company had the choice to see what the most suitable location was. For the installation of a
	conveyor belt, as it was the case in Meise, a room of 65 m² was needed.</p>
