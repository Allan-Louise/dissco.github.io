# DiSSCo Digitisation Community Manual
This repository hosts the [DiSSCo Digitisation Guide](https://dissco.github.io/) website for [DiSSCo](https://dissco.eu), which is being developed in 
[DiSSCo Prepare](https://www.dissco.eu/dissco-prepare/) as part of Work Package 3 "Capacity Enhancement".

It uses GitHub Pages with the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll theme

## Contributing a Workflow
We have written a [guidance page](https://dissco.github.io/Guidance/GitHub.html) describing how to submit a workflow. All workflows are reviewed before being added to the site, and we can provide advice and guidance to those who want to contribute. You can also contribute to our best practice guidance, either by raising an issue directly suggesting edits to the pages. Suggested amendments will be reviewed by the team.
