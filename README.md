# DiSSCo Digitisation Community Manual
This repository hosts the [DiSSCo Digitisation Guide](https://dissco.github.io/) website for [DiSSCo](https://dissco.eu), which was developed in 
[DiSSCo Prepare](https://www.dissco.eu/dissco-prepare/) as part of Work Package 3 "Capacity Enhancement".

It uses GitHub Pages with the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll theme

## Contributing a Workflow or Digitisation Best Practice
We have written a [guidance page](https://dissco.github.io/Guidance/GitHub.html) describing how to submit a workflow. All workflows are reviewed before being added to the site, and we can provide advice and guidance to those who want to contribute. 

You can also contribute to our best practice guidance, either by raising an [issue](https://github.com/DiSSCo/dissco.github.io/issues) or suggesting an edit to the guidance (each page has an 'edit this page' link). Suggested amendments will be reviewed by the team.
