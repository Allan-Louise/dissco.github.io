# DiSSCo Digitisation Community Manual
This repository hosts the [DiSSCo Digitisation Guide](https://dissco.github.io/) website for [DiSSCo](https://dissco.eu), which is being developed in 
[DiSSCo Prepare](https://www.dissco.eu/dissco-prepare/) as part of Work Package 3 "Capacity Enhancement".

It uses GitHub Pages with the [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll theme

## Contributing a Workflow
We have written a [guidance page](https://dissco.github.io/Guidance/GitHub.html) describing how to submit a workflow. All workflows are reviewed before being added to the site, and we can provide advice and guidance to those who want to contribute.
