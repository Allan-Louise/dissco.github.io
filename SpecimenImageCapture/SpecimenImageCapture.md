# Introduction
We have all personally created thousands of digital images in our lifetimes and are comforatbly familar using cameras to take photos of everytday life.

In digitisation the best way to supplement a digital record of a specimen is to have an accompanying image which captures the specimen. The imaging of specimens is typically performed using either a camera or a flat-bed scanner, although 3D scanning of specimens has also [applied]() despite the added time and financial costs.

**Photography** is by far the simplest and widely used method to capture digital information about museum specimens. In fact some of the first photographs taken by camera pioneer William Fox Talbot in the were of botanical specimens which look very simailar to those we take today.

Specimen photography (or macro-photography) is the most widely used and easiest approach to digitisation imaging, and typically involves taking either a single or multiple images of a specimen using a camera. The cameras involved should be reasonably familiar to most users and donâ€™t differ much from those that can be bought off the shelf.  

We have put together an [introductory module for specimen photography](https://lmfrench.github.io/SpecimenImageCapture/photographymodule.html) that aims clearify the objectives, technical information, and jargon associated with specimen photography. This should be a guide to making sense of specimen photography for your own digitalisation efforts and allow you to understand the advice given in the specimen workflows.

We will additionally put together these pages - 1) a kit list of generally recommended imaging equipment with pricing; 2) a gallery of images of good specimen photographs.
