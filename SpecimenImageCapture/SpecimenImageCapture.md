# Introduction
We have all personally created thousands of digital images in our lifetimes and are familar with using cameras to take photos of everytday life.

In digitisation the best way to supplement a digital record of a specimen is to have an accompanying image which shows the specimen. The imaging of specimens is typically performed using either a camera or a flat-bed scanner, although 3D scanning of specimens has also applied, e.g. [Plum and Labonte 2021](https://peerj.com/articles/11155/) despite the added time and financial costs.

**Photography** is by far the simplest and widely used method to capture digital information about museum specimens. In fact some of the first photographs taken by camera pioneer William Fox Talbot in the were of botanical specimens which look very simailar to those we take today.

Specimen photography (or macro-photography) typically involves taking either a single or multiple images of a specimen using a camera. The cameras involved typically s donâ€™t differ much from those that can be bought off the shelf.  

We have put together an [introductory module for specimen photography](https://lmfrench.github.io/SpecimenImageCapture/photographymodule.html) that aims clarify the objectives, technical specifications, and jargon associated with specimen photography. This should be a guide to making sense of photography in your own digitisation efforts and allow you to understand the advice given in the specimen workflows.
