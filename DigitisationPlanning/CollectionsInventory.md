## 1. Detailed inventory of the collection (Number of Specimens)

Before you start digitising your collection, it is really important to know the content of your
collection. If you do not have a clear overview of the type of collections, the numbers, the
arrangement and the status of your collection, it is very hard to estimate the work and the costs of
your future digitisation projects.
	
For case studies see <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6511350">Detailed inventory of the collections for DiSSCo Flanders</a> and 
<a href="/Digitisation/PreDigCuration/PDCaseStudies.html#setting-natural-science-data-free-scoping-uk-collections-disscouk">Scoping UK Collections</a>.
	
### 1.1 Kind of collections
The approach to digitising each collection can be very diverse. Therefore, it is very important to
divide your collection into different sub-collections with a similar digitising approach. List the
numbers for the different kinds of collections. It is also useful to know if these collections are kept
separately or not, as it will influence the workflow.
<ul>
	<li>Microscope slides </li>
	<li>Skins and vertebrate material </li>
	<li>Liquid preserved specimens </li>
	<li>Pinned insects </li>
	<li>Herbarium sheets </li>
	<li>3D objects</li>
	<li>Other </li>
</ul>
	
### 1.2 Estimation of the numbers of your (sub)collections
For each kind of collection type, it is useful to have a trustworthy estimate of your holdings. It will not
only facilitate the project planning related to management, staff, equipment and working space but it
is also important when you want to outsource your imaging and/or transcription. Mass digitisation of
a collection is only cost effective above a minimum threshold of the number of specimens.

collection at Meise Botanic Garden</a> and <a href="/Digitisation/PreDigCuration/PDCaseStudies.html#estimation-of-collection-size-at-the-nhm-london">Estimation of collection size at NHM London</a>.

### 1.3 Classification system of the different collections
The classification of your collection is crucial in the way you can set up your digitisation workflow.
Some information can only be found on the specimen itself but some information can be found on
the folders/drawers/cupboards and is the same for all specimens in the same folder/ drawer/
cupboard. That information is very valuable as it can be directly linked to all specimens in it. This can
save time and money.

For example vascular plant specimens in the herbarium BR of Meise Botanic Garden are stored in
alphabetical order by family, genus and species. Therefore we could digitise the filing name from the
folders (a QR code was added to a folder every time the filing name changed) instead of digitising it
from the sheets. So all the folders with a QR code were imaged as well and based on these images,
the filing name was transcribed. This QR code of the filing name was linked to all the specimens that
followed. It saved us a lot of duplicate work as on average 1 folder was linked to 10 sheets.
	
### 1.4 Assessment of the condition of your (sub)collections
A crucial step in the pre-digitisation phase is to find out the curational status of your collection to
know how much curatorial work is needed before your collection is ready for digitisation. As you will
probably digitise your collections only once, you would want to do it properly.

<a href="https://www.synthesys.info/network-activities/synthesys3-na3.html">The SYNTHESYS3 NA3 deliverable 3.3 report</a> describes the outcome of a questionnaire that was sent
around to 18 partners to review digitisation workflows and the used equipment. Two thirds of the
institutions that completed the questionnaire performed at least some minimal curation or
conservation steps prior to digitisation.
	
#### 1.4.1 Curation Status
<ul>
	<li>Mounting needed</li>
	<p>As mounting is much more time consuming than imaging (for herbarium specimens it
	is 50 to 5000 per day, Guiraud et al. 2020), it is best to decouple the mounting
	process from the digitisation workflow.</p>
	<li>Desleeving/unfolding/opening needed</li>
	<li>Cleaning needed</li>
	<li>Restoration needed</li>
	<li>Renewal of the folders/boxes/jars/drawers needed</li>
	<li>Refiling needed (for example removing obviously incorrectly filed items)</li>
	<li>No curation needed</li>
</ul>

While checking the curatorial state of your collection, you can already start making a list of necessary
supplies (see <a href="/Digitisation/PreDigCuration/PreDigCuration.html#3-supplies">section 3</a> for supply lists).
	
#### 1.4.2 Toxicity list & risk assessment
Many collections have been treated in the past with chemicals that are now
considered as unsafe: herbarium collections could have been treated with mercury,
nitrobenzene, naphthalene (in mothballs) or other chemicals; vertebrate skins with
arsenic, geology collections store asbestos-containing material or can be radioactive.
Liquid collections can contain formaldehyde or other harmful substances. Mould and
biological hazards form other problems that can be found in collections.

List all the toxins that were used in your collection to make sure that you take the
necessary precautions.

This is not only necessary for the people who work with the collections on a daily
basis but it is also important when you plan to outsource the digitisation of your
collection. It is recommended to inform the external company and to make a risk
assessment.

For a case study see <a href="/Digitisation/PreDigCuration/PDCaseStudies.html#decontamination-of-parts-of-the-herbarium-at-meise-botanic-garden">Decontamination of parts of the herbarium</a> at Meise Botanic
Garden, and useful literature can be found <a href="https://know.dissco.eu/handle/item/403/simple-search?filterquery=Toxicity&filtername=subject&filtertype=equals">here</a>
	
#### 1.4.3 Labels readable
It is important to know is the readability of the specimen labels when digitised. Sometimes they are
hidden underneath (part of) the specimen and will not be readable from the image. Will you
reposition the label before digitisation? Will you transcribe the information from the specimen itself
or from the image?
