# Transcription

## Overview
Transcription is often the most time-consuming and resource intensive element of a digitisation workflow. This page provides a brief overview of 'in house' transcription, where a transcriber manually transcribes specimen labels. 
Much more information is available in the links listed under 'Other Sources'.

## Workflow

### Project Planning

We recommend working very closely with the curator or project lead to determine a plan for transcription before a project starts. You will need to decide what, if anything, you will be transcribing from the labels. 
For most projects it is likely only part of the label information will be transcribed, but there may be projects where the full label information is beneficial. The diagram below shows the key areas to consider before starting a project.

**Verbatim vs Interpretation:**\
You should agree with the curator or project lead in advance what label information will be transcribed verbatim or what items can be interpreted. You should also define rules around interpretation, so all transcribers are following the same practices.
For example, some curators may prefer locality to be transcribed in a specific order, by perhaps always recording the largest area first,  whereas others might prefer locality to be transcribed exactly how it appeared
on the label.

Interpreted data is often better for improving the finability of specimens and aggregating data, but  recording verbatim data can help for later data cleaning if something has been interpreted incorrectly. Label images
are often now used in place of verbatim transcription (Wilkinson *et al.*, 2016, Groom *et al.* 2019). 

Even when transcribing verbatim, there will be instances where some interpretation may be neccessary - for example if handwriting is difficult to read or the label has faded. You should decide rules around how this should be recorded.

**Multi-determination:**\ 
Some specimens may have multiple species determinations, and you will need to decide whether to transcribe all determinations or perhaps only the most recent determination.

**Unknown or incomplete data:**\
You should agree how data that is missing from the label will be recorded. Most transcription projects do not record all label data, and it is important that afterwards you can differentiate between information that was
missing from the label, and data that was not entered by the transcriber.

Data may also be incomplete, for example the label may not have complete locality information and again you should ensure you can distinguish between incomplete data and data that was not entered.

### Transcription Workflow

This shows an example workflow for a transcription project. 

* In some projects, label images will be used for transcription. In others, the labels may be transcribed directly from the specimen. There is often a mix of approaches with, for example, taxonomic information being transcribed during imaging and the rest of the label transcribed from the images at a later date.
* Transcription data will often be transcribed into a spreadsheet, as shown in this workflow, with a database manager later importing this into the institution's collection management system afterwards. This is often much faster than entering data directly into the collections management system.

**Languages:**
Specimen label information is often written in a language that the transcriber is not fluent in. You should decide whether this label information will be transcribed. It is likely the transcriber will need to transcribe these labels verbatim, 
and they may also misinterpet which field the information should be recorded under (Groom *et al.* 2019). It is particularly difficult to transcribe labels using writing systems not familiar to the transcriber.
 
There may be symbols that are not found on the transcriber's keyboard, for example UK keyboards do not typically include accented letters.
