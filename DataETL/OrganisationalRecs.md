## Overview
Different institutions have different organisation structures for digitisation. Some may have their
own in-house IT development staff, whereas some may outsource digitisation to contractors. 

For example, at the Finnish Museum of Natural History (Luomus), the digitisation workflow involves a
digitisation team and three IT staff, one digitisation software developer/manager, one server
administrator, and a data manager (Luo1). There are digitisers and one IT manager at Herbarium
Jo√£o de Carvalho e Vasconcellos (LISI), Universidade de Lisboa. For the Natural History Museum
(NHM) London, digitisers and the data management team are involved in digitisation workflows.
Different models have their advantages and disadvantages, which should be well considered before
the starting of digitisation activities based on an institutions own situations.

## Recommendations

### Automnation and Software Developers (O1 & O2) ###
<details>
	<summary> <strong>Click here to expand:</strong> This best practice describes the benefits of automation and software development.</summary>
<p><strong>Level:</strong> Basic </p>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> As a museum director I want to use limited monetary resources efficiently so that I can provide best value to society.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
<p>O1: Automate recurrent routine tasks as much as possible as part of the ETL
process.</p>
<p>O2: Employ/acquire one or few software developers instead of adding
more digitisation staff to speed up digitisation.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Software development is expensive, but spending development resources
in automating tasks will eventually save money by reducing staff costs (or
allow using those staff more efficiently).</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Example:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of having staff manually create thumbnails with an image editor,
develop an image service that does the job; use existing image libraries
available (such as ImageMagick).</p>
