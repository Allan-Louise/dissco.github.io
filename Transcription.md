## Overview
Transcription is often the most time-consuming and resource intensive element of a digitisation workflow. This page provides a brief overview of manual transcription, with a focus on project planning.

## Workflow

### Project Planning

We recommend working very closely with the curator or project lead to determine a plan for transcription before a project starts. You will need to decide what, if anything, you will be transcribing from the labels. 
For most projects it is likely only part of the label information will be transcribed, but there may be projects where the full label information is beneficial. The diagram below shows the key areas to consider before starting a project.

**This section needs to be amended to include something about DarwinCore*

**Verbatim vs Interpretation:**\
You should agree with the curator or project lead in advance what label information will be transcribed verbatim or what items can be interpreted. You should also define rules around interpretation, so all transcribers are following the same practices.
For example, some curators may prefer locality to be transcribed in a specific order, by perhaps always recording the largest area first, whereas others might prefer locality to be transcribed exactly how it appeared on the label. 

Interpreted data is often better for improving the findability of specimens and aggregating data, but recording verbatim data can help for later data cleaning if something has been interpreted incorrectly. Label images are often now used in place of verbatim transcription (Wilkinson *et al.*, 2016, Groom *et al.* 2019). 

Even when transcribing verbatim, there will be instances where some interpretation may be necessary - for example if handwriting is difficult to read or the label has faded. You should decide rules around how this should be recorded.

**Multi-determination:** 
Some specimens may have multiple species determinations, and you will need to decide whether to transcribe all determinations or perhaps only the most recent determination.

**Unknown or incomplete data:**\
You should agree how data that is missing from the label will be recorded. Most transcription projects do not record all label data, and it is important that afterwards you can differentiate between information that was
missing from the label, and data that was not entered by the transcriber.

Data may also be incomplete, for example the label may not have complete locality information and again you should ensure you can distinguish between incomplete data and data that was not entered.

### Transcription Workflow

![Image shows a transcription workflow](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/TranscWF.PNG?raw=true)
This shows an example workflow for a transcription project. 

* In some projects, label images will be used for transcription. In others, the labels may be transcribed directly from the specimen. There is often a mix of approaches with, for example, taxonomic information being transcribed during imaging and the rest of the label transcribed from the images at a later date.
* Transcription data will often be transcribed into a spreadsheet, as shown in this workflow, with a database manager later importing this into the institution's collection management system afterwards. This is often much faster than entering data directly into the collections management system.  

## Costs and Transcription Rates

## Impact and Effort Matrix
![Image shows an impact effort matrix](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/ImpactEffort.PNG?raw=true)

Using an impact effort matrix at the start of a transcription project can help teams to determine what to transcribe. 

The first step is to identify the main objectives and goals for the transcription project. This can help with assessing the potential impact of transcribing each field.

The potential resource requirements for transcribing becomes easier to assess the more transcription projects you do, particularly if you keep a record of past transcription rates. 

Once you have an estimate of the impact and resource implications for transcribing each field, you can then add them to the impact effort matrix. It is likely you will want to transcribe anything classified in the 'high impact, low effort' quadrant, and not transcribe fields in the 'low impact, high effort' quadrant.

It is a good idea to continually assess resource during a project, particularly if you are working with a collection that the team was unfamiliar with. You may need to make adjustments to the fields that are transcribed if it is more time-consuming than expected.

The impact and effort for each transcription task will differ between projects - sometimes it might be really important to geo-reference, and for others this may have less impact. The amount of resources available and the expertise of the transcribers may also differ between projects, as will the readability of the specimen labels.

## Challenges
**Multi-specimen sheets:** 
Multiple specimens can often be found on herbarium sheets. This can be challenging to transcribe, as it is often not clear which labels are associated with each specimen.

**Languages:**
Specimen label information is often written in a language that the transcriber is not fluent in. You should decide whether this label information will be transcribed, or whether this should be skipped. It is likely the transcriber will need to transcribe these labels verbatim, 
and they may also misinterpret the correct data field. It is particularly difficult to transcribe labels using writing systems not familiar to the transcriber ((Groom *et al.* 2019, )
 
There may be symbols that are not found on the transcriber's keyboard, for example UK keyboards do not typically include accented letters. The [Useful Shortcuts](https://usefulshortcuts.com/alt-codes/accents-alt-codes.php) website can be used to either copy and paste the required letter, or to find the keyboard shortcut

**Collection Date**
Partial dates are often found on transcription labels - for example, only recording month and year. The year can also be shortened, meaning interpretation is required to know whether for example '27' refers to 1827 or 1927.
