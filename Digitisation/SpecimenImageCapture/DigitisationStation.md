# Digitisation Station

## Introduction

This page provides an overview of the equipment we use in some of our digitisation workflows at the Natural History Museum, London (NHM). We have listed the equipment we currently use in this setup, although there are others available with similar specifications.

We will be adding more guidance about digitisation equipment, including scanners, cameras and barcode readers, so check back soon!

## Hardware

The image below shows an example of a digitisation station at the NHM. It includes a camera, stand and lightbox. Specimens are positioned in the lightbox, and images are captured using a button on the computer.

In the middle, there is a digitisation station, with a camera held on a copy stand above a lightbox. On the righthand side are two monitors, one which shows the picture that will be captured by the camera: in this case a microscope slide." width="500"/>

**Digitisation Equipment**\

Lightbox - This is currently custom made at the Natural History Museum, London. Please get in touch with us ([dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk](mailto:dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk)) for more information.

**Computer Set-up**\
This is the computer set-up we use alongside this digitisation station. See [this page](/DataManagement/Data.html) for more information about IT infrastructure and data management in digitisation projects.\

## Workflows
We use this digitisation set-up for many of our digitisation projects at the NHM, including:\
[Microscope Slides](/MicroscopeSlides/MicroscopeSlideMassDig.html)\
[Pinned Insects](/PinnedInsect/NHM%20single%20camera%20pinned%20insects.html)

We are piloting this set-up with other institutions within the [DiSSCo UK](https://dissco-uk.org) network, and hope to include more workflows on this site soon.

The table below shows the digitisation rates achieved using this set-up in our microscope slide workflow (Allan *et al.*, 2019).

Table: Estimates of digitised slides per person per day

|                           | Digisiters (focused testing*) | Digitisers(real world) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------- |
| Min  (a)                  | 476                           | 370                    |  
| Max  (b)                  | 1103                          | 1006                   |
| Median (m)                | 741                           | 700                    |
| Base rate (a+4m+b)/6      | 757                           | 696                    | 
| Standard Deviation (b-a)/6| 105                           | 106                    |
| Error Rate                | 0.006                                                  |

*focused testing shows the rate when only digitisation activities are occurring, which is unlikely to be achieved in every day work due to meetings and other interuptions
