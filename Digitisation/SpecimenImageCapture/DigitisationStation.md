## Introduction

This page describes the equipment used in digitisation stations at the Natural History Museum, London and Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. 

We will be adding more guidance about digitisation equipment, including scanners,cameras and barcode readers, so check back soon. Please also see our [Software](/DataManagement/Software/Software.html) page for more information about the software we use in our digitisation workflows.

## Digitisation Station - Natural History Museum, London
The equipment listed below is used in some of the digitisation stations at the Natural History Museum, London (NHM). We have listed the equipment currently used in this setup, although there are others available with similar specifications.

### Hardware

The image below shows an example of a digitisation station at the NHM. It includes a camera, stand and lightbox. Specimens are positioned in the lightbox, and images are captured using a button on the computer.

In the middle, there is a digitisation station, with a camera held on a copy stand above a lightbox. On the righthand side are two monitors, one which shows the picture that will be captured by the camera: in this case a microscope slide." width="500"/>

### Workflows
This digitisation set-up is used in many of our digitisation projects at the NHM, including:\
[Microscope Slides](/MicroscopeSlides/MicroscopeSlideMassDig.html)\
[Pinned Insects](/PinnedInsect/NHM%20single%20camera%20pinned%20insects.html)

This station is being piloted with other institutions within the [DiSSCo UK](https://dissco-uk.org) network, and we hope to include more workflows on this site soon.

The table below shows the digitisation rates achieved using this set-up in our microscope slide workflow (Allan *et al.*, 2019).

Table: Estimates of digitised slides per person per day

|                           | Digisiters (focused testing*) | Digitisers(real world) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------- |
| Min  (a)                  | 476                           | 370                    |

| Base rate (a+4m+b)/6      | 757                           | 696                    | 
| Standard Deviation (b-a)/6| 105                           | 106                    |
| Error Rate                | 0.006                                                  |

*focused testing shows the rate when only digitisation activities are occurring, which is unlikely to be achieved in every day work due to meetings and other interuptions

## Herbarium Sheet Imaging Station - Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh

This section describes the equipment for the herbarium sheet imaging station that is used at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE).

### Hardware
The digitisation stations at RBGE consist of a camera, lightbox and copy stand, which is set up alongside a computer.

<img src="/images/Photography/HerbariumStation.png" alt="a picture of a digitisation station. On the lefthand side, there is a person standing next to a lightbox holding a barcode scanner. There is a camera above the lightbox. There is a computer monitor on the right hand side, showing the image of a herbarium sheet that will be captured by the camera" width="500"/>

**Camera Equipment**\
Following testing of several camera options, RBGE selected a Fujifilm camera that gave a good quality images at a reasonable price. These cameras are being installed in RBGE's imaging stations in order to standardise the set-up.

* [Fujifilm GFX 100 Medium Format camera body](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/gfx100/): 102 MP, 43.8mm x 32.9mm sensor size. Given that the power adaptor for this camera has been discontinued, the [GFX 100S camera body](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/gfx100s/) would be an alternative option
* [Fujifilm GF 63mm f2.8 R WR Lens](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/gf63mmf28-r-wr/)
* [TetherTools TetherPro USB-C to USB-C 10ft (3m) Orange](https://tethertools.com/product/tetherpro-usb-c-to-usb-c-2/)

<img src="/images/Photography/HerbariumStationCamera.png" alt="a picture of a camera positioned above a lightbox. There is a hole in the lightbox which the camera is setup above using a copy stand, which allows the camera to take images of herbarium sheets placed within the lightbox." width="500"/>


**Lightbox**\
RBGE were unable to find  a lightbox available that fitted their needs, so they worked with two different suppliers/manufacturers to develop suitable products.

Two options are currently used, both custom built to RBGE specifications:
* [Cirro Lite LEDCloud PhotoBox](https://www.cirrolite.com/)
* [Stoane Lighting Bespoke photography light box V2](https://stoanelighting.com/) product number 001826

**Copy Stand**\
The lightboxes have been constructed to fit the Kaiser copy stand.

* [Kaiser Copy Base Board with Socket and Adjustable Feet 80x60](https://www.kaiser-fototechnik.de/en/produkte/artikel.php?nr=5519)
* [Kaiser Column 1m with Friction Drive](https://www.kaiser-fototechnik.de/en/produkte/artikel.php?nr=4474)
* [Kaiser Camera Arm RTX](https://www.kaiser-fototechnik.de/en/produkte/artikel.php?nr=5522)

**Adjustable Table**\
An adjustable table has been an important part of the RBGE imaging stations, enabling the Lightbox and camera to be set at a suitable, ergonomic height for each individual digitiser.

Two options currently being used, both including customised options from existing products:
* [ErgoSwiss Table base TA](https://www.ergoswiss.com/en/product-range/table-base-frames/table-base-ta)
* [Sciquip 4 leg Static Electric Height Laboratory Table, 1800mm](https://sciquip.co.uk/2-leg-static-electric-height-laboratory-tables.html)

**Colour Targets**\
The colour target is fixed on the imaging set-up, so dimensions were chosen that would fit the dimensions of the specimen as much as possible.
* [GoldenThread object target](https://www.imagescienceassociates.com/object-level-target-family.html)

**Computer**\
RBGE use a Mac computer in their imaging stations - having tried both PCs and Macs, they found a Mac reduced software issues.

* [Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/uk/mac-mini/) with either an Intel Core i7 Processor, 32GB RAM or a M1 Processor, 16GB RAM

* [BenQ SW2700PT 27 Inch Monitor](https://www.benq.com/en-me/monitor/photographer/sw2700pt.html) or equivalent

**Tethering Software**\
Several options were explored for tethering software to be able to process images captured in RAW format, with [CaptureOne](https://www.captureone.com) now used.

**Image Editing Software**\
Some simple editing software is used to manage specimens that need multiple images e.g. material in capsules: [Adobe Photoshop Elements](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-elements.html) 

### Workflows
This imaging station is used in the [RBGE Herbarium Sheet Mass Digitisation](/HerbariumSheets/RBGEHerbariumSheet.html) workflow.
