## Overview
This section gives a brief (2-3 sentence) overview of the workflow
## Workflow
These sections are used to add BPMN workflows. Text can also be included to help someone follow the workflow. Not all subheadings will be required for every workflow.

![Overview of the Mass Digitisation workflow](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/RBGE%20BPMN%20workflow%20overview.PNG?raw=true)

**Pre-Digitisation Curation**

There are three key tasks that form the pre-digitisation task cluster at RBGE:

1. Genus and Species Covers
2. Taxonomy and Names
3. Conservation Assessment


**Genus and Species covers**

![Pre-Digitisation Curation: Genus and Species covers workflow](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/RBGE%20BPMN%20Genus%20and%20Species%20covers.PNG?raw=true)

A key part of the pre-digitisation curation is to ensure that key information for the finding of specimens is present and correct on both the genus and species covers.  The collections are organised systematically firstly by family number. Within families the specimens are ordered by genus number. Genera are then organised by geographic regions that the specimens were collected. Within each genus cover the specimens are in species covers, with the species epithet on the bottom right hand corner of the cover. 

![Genus cover overview](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/RBGE%20Genus%20cover%20information.PNG?raw=ture)

![Species cover overview](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/RBGE%20species%20cover.PNG?raw=ture)

If either genus or species folders are too full they are split into additional folders to help ensure that the specimens are stored well, to help ensure their long term preservation.

If any specimens are particularly large or bulky, they should be placed at the top of the specimen cover to reduce the risk of specimens warping and becoming damaged.

**Taxonomy and Names**

![Pre-Digitisation Curation: Taxonomy and Names workflow](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/RBGE%20BPMN%20Taxonomy%20%26%20Names.PNG?raw=true)

For this project the names are entered as they are found in the cabinets, a later project will assess all of the names in use and determine whether they should be use. The key principal is that the name used should allow the specimens to be found.

If a name is not present in the database it needs to be added. We are recommending the use of certain online resouces for this purpose:

1. IPNI (https://www.ipni.org/)
2. Tropicos (www.tropicos.org)

Other resources if the name cannot be found above include:
* The World Flora Online (http://www.worldfloraonline.org/)
* Plants of the World Online (POWO) (http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/)

**Conservation Assessment**

![Pre-Digitisation Curation: Conservation Assessment workflow](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/RBGE%20BPMN%20Conservation%20Assessment.PNG?raw=true)

Whilst this step is included as part of the Pre-digitisation curation task cluster it is generally carried out after the Electronic Data Capture prior to Specimen Image Capture.

Where possible the repair work is carried out prior to the specimen being imaged.

Examples of conservation interventions:

* Replacing non-brass paperclips or pins - non-brass materials can become rusty and cause damage to the specimen
![A rusty paperclip holding a paper capsule closed](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/RBGE%20rusty%20paperclip.PNG?raw=true)

* Placing a fragile specimenin a protective cover - if a specimen is on fragile or brittle paper it can be placed in a protective cover to prevent further damage
![A specimen mounted on brittle paper](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/RBGE%20fragile%20specimen.PNG?raw=true)

Examples of repairs:

* Specimens mounted on very small sheets of paper, or attached with pins - these specimens can cause damage to other specimens within the species cover and need to be mounted on to a larger sheet.

* Specimens with loose or broken pieces - if a specimen is fragile or mounted on too flexible a mounting board it can cause the specimen to break. Depending on the extent of the damage it is possible for small pieces of loose material to be added to a capsule if present on the sheet. If the damage is more extensive it needs to be repaired by the conservator

* Specimens with cellophane covering material or fixed with sellotape - where possible these are imaged following the repair.
