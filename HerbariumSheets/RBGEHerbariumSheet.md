## Overview
This section gives a brief (2-3 sentence) overview of the workflow
## Workflow
These sections are used to add BPMN workflows. Text can also be included to help someone follow the workflow. Not all subheadings will be required for every workflow.

**Pre-Digitisation Curation**

Genus and Species covers

![Pre-Digitisation Curation: Genus and Species covers workflow](https://github.com/lmfrench/lmfrench.github.io/blob/main/images/RBGE%20BPMN%20Genus%20and%20Species%20covers.PNG?raw=true)

A key part of the pre-digitisation curation is to ensure that key information for the finding of specimens is present and correct on both the genus and species covers.  The collections are organised systematically firstly by family number. Within families the specimens are ordered by genus number. Genera are then organised by geographic regions that the specimens were collected. Within each genus cover the specimens are in species covers, with the species epithet on the bottom right hand corner of the cover.

If either genus or species folders are too full they are split into additional folders to help ensure that the specimens are stored well, to help ensure their long term preservation.
