**Welcome to the DiSSCo Digitisation Guides website.** 

This site contains guidance and workflows to help you digitise your collections, and is being developed as part of the [Distributed System of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo)](https://dissco.eu) project. We hope to help increase digitisation capacity across Europe, by helping natural sciences collection-holding institutions share best practices.

All elements of this website are under development, and we are sharing it to get feedback from the community. This means you might see some images that are difficult to see, or sections of the site that arenâ€™t yet written or incomplete. 

We welcome feedback,  so please get in touch with us at lisa.french@nhm.ac.uk or add a new issue to our [GitHub](https://github.com/DiSSCo/dissco.github.io/issues). Please also let us know what guidance you would like to see added to the site, either via e-mail or GitHub, as this will help us to prioritise our next steps.

All institutions are able to contribute to this website, so please see our [contributor guidance](https://dissco.github.io/Guidance/ContributorGuidance.html) for more information on how to submit a workflow. 

## Additional Funding

The following workflows have been funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council:
