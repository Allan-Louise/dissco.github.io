## Welcome to the DiSSCo Digitisation Guides website

This site contains guidance and workflows to help you digitise your collections, and is being developed as part of the [Distributed System of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo)](https://dissco.eu) project.

We want to increase digitisation capacity across Europe, by helping natural science collection-holding institutions to share best practices.

All elements of this website are under development. This means you may notice that some sections of the site are incomplete, or that some of the images are difficult to see. We are working to update this.

We welcome feedback,  so please get in touch with us at lisa.french@nhm.ac.uk or add a new issue to our [GitHub](https://github.com/DiSSCo/dissco.github.io/issues). Please also let us know what guidance you would like to see added to the site, either via e-mail or GitHub, as this will help us to prioritise our next steps.

All institutions are able to contribute to this website, so please see our [contributor guidance](https://dissco.github.io/Guidance/ContributorGuidance.html) for more information on how to submit a workflow. 

### Additional Funding

The following workflows have been funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council:
