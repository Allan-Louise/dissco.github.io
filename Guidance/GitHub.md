# Contributing Workflows

## Overview

This page describes how you can contribute a workflow and standard operating procedure to the digitisation guides.

There are two options: You can either contact one of the site administrators, who will help you write the workflow (including guidance on how to create BPMN diagrams), or you can directly contribute through our GitHub.

## Guidance on Creating Workflows

We have created a [template](https://dissco.github.io/Template.html) to use when writing a workflow: most of the headings are optional, but please follow this structure rather than creating your own. This helps users to compare workflows, so they can choose the one which best suits their situation.

The [BPMN page](https://dissco.github.io/Guidance/BPMN.html) provides guidance on how to create the workflow diagrams. We will soon be adding some guidance on the suggested level of detail to include in the workflows, but in the mean time you can get in touch with us for help (see contact details above).

## 1. Contact Details
This site is currently being developed as part of [DiSSCo Prepare](https://www.dissco.eu/dissco-prepare/). You can contact Lisa French (lisa.french@nhm.ac.uk) at the Natural History Museum, London, or email info@dissco.eu

## 2. GitHub Contributions

New workflows and standard operating procedures can also be submitted through the [DiSSCo Digitisation Guides GitHub](https://github.com/DiSSCo/dissco.github.io). You can do this by cloning or forking the repository, making your own changes, and then creating a pull request. We will then get a notification about your pull request, which will allow us to review the new workflow before we add it to the website.

We suggest using the [template page](https://github.com/DiSSCo/dissco.github.io/blob/main/Template.md) on GitHub as a starting point to writing your workflow. Markdown can be used for most of the formatting on a page, but we sometimes use html as well.

If this is your first time using GitHub, and you would like to learn how to use it, we would be happy to talk you through the process. You can contact Lisa French (lisa.french@nhm.ac.uk). GitHub also provides [guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on how to use pull requests.
